          <p>
            Hey there! My name is Adrian. I'm a former civil engineer turned
            full-stack web developer. I enjoy building things and bringing
            concepts to life. Over the past 5 years, I worked comfortably as a
            Civil Engineer - Creating aesthetically pleasing facades for
            buildings that were occupied by companies such as Google, Linkedin,
            and Stanford. Despite having a steady career and being able marvel at a completed structure I helped build, I wasn't passionate about the work I did and grew bored.
           <p>
            I was always fascinated by tech growing up and have always been around computers. My family always turned towards me for I.T. related issues and I always loved tinkering around with software. I decided to take a few online programming courses
            to gauge my interest in programming. About 3 hours later, I knew that this was the career for me. I enjoyed the problem solving aspects of it as well as the struggle/challenge of getting code to run. I still throw my hands up in the air and scream "Yes!" everytime I figure something out.
            So I enrolled in Thinkful/Bloc's full-stack web development track to accelerate my learning in hopes of switching careers. Check out some of the cool stuff I've built below!
